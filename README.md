>>mountain biking
The sport of mountain biking is one of the best active sports you can do for a number of fitness reasons and depending on what
style of mountain biking you partake in, it can be also a great deal of fun as well as keeping you fit at the same time.

People are usually unaware of how many muscles you use when riding a mountain bike, and how quickly you can burn calories
off riding a bike as it can be an extremely good work out for the body.

If you plan on riding cross-country along different styles of trails, riding a bike can be quite a task. So if you riding over a vast
distance up and down hills, along slippery single trail it can be very exhausting on the legs and the lower back.

So if you are just starting to ride bikes for the first time, please don't just jump on the bike and go for a 20 mile ride as it may do
you more harm than good. One thing that is recommended is to do short rides to start with, maybe only a couple of miles which
will take no time at all on a bike to get your fitness training up to scratch before hitting the bike ride.

>>mother n son
A child belongs to a poor background. One day when he was returning home from school with his friends, they (his friends)
bought candies. He, however, had no money but still stole the candy because he wanted one. He did not eat it there, he went to
his home and shared it with his mother. His mother 'appreciated' this and gave him a hug.

This was a significant event in his childhood as the fact that his mother appreciated the fruit of his theft reinforced into his psyche
that it was OK to steal things which you cannot buy. As we see later, this is repeated in his life at various points.

When the child grew, his friends got bicycles and he too wanted one. And just like the candy in his early years, he stole the bicycle
too. He goes on to show the bicycle to his mom. She likes the fact that he has the bicycle in his possession and remarks that he
can now go 'home from the school faster' and gives him a hug.

This event again reiterates the fact that stealing is OK, in fact, it is appreciated by his mother. at this point, this is engraved in the
child's mind. Also, another fact to notice is that the mother says he can come home from school faster, rather than reaching
school faster and early or on time. This also shows where her moral compass lies. The other fact to note at this point is that she
never asks what is the sources of the things that he got.

After several years, the kid grows to be a man. He steals a car when his friends get cars. He takes it to his home and shows it to his
mom.

>>dont quit
During a research experiment, a shark was placed into the large tank of water and then some small fish were released into that
tank. As you would expect the shark quickly swam around the tank watched the fish and then ended up eating all of them. Then a
strong piece of fiberglass was inserted into the tank.

This would create a division between where the shark started and where the smaller fish started. Again the shark quickly
attacked but this time the shark went in straight into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.

It tried this several times again and again and again until it became tired and weakened. Meanwhile, the fish on the other side of
the divider carried on swimming peacefully. After about an hour the shark finally gave up.

This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks, where the shark became less aggressive every single
time. It got to the point that the shark stopped trying to attack and eat the fish at all. The fiberglass was then removed out of the
tank, and to their amazement, the shark still did not attack.

The shark had been trained through habit that a fiberglass divider was there and that it would bounce off and therefore didn't
even consider it. At the same time, the small fish freely swam wherever they wanted.
The moral of the story:-
Many of us are experiencing setbacks and failures in everyday life. Eventually, we get emotionally drained, tired, unmotivated
and we stop trying. Like the shark in the story, we all believe that because we've been unsuccessful in the past that that barrier
still exists, even for new ventures.

In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads that separates us from our dreams even though there is no real barrier.
Don't let anything stop you. Not the resistance, the obstacles, your self-doubt, your circumstances, the length of the journey, your
failures, or your past.

little match girl
It was the last night of the year. It had snowed, and it was very cold outside. Now it was nearly dark. In the cold and dark walked a
poor little girl. She had no hat. She had no shoes. When she left home, she had shoes. They were very large. They had been her
mother's. But she had run across the street to avoid a fast horse. The shoes were so big, they fell off as she ran.

Another child had found one shoe. He ran off with it. She couldn't find the other. So the little girl walked on with her tiny, naked
feet. They were quite red and numb from cold.

The girl had many matches. She sold them for money. She kept most of them in an old apron. She held a bundle of them in her
hand so people could see. But nobody had bought any from her the whole day. No one had given her a single cent.

And now she was hungry. She had no money for food. She couldn't stay warm. Her body shook as she walked along. The flakes of
snow covered her long, fair hair. It fell in lovely curls around her neck. But she didn't feel pretty.

Right now she felt alone. She passed many houses. Candles shone in all the windows. And the air smelled of roast goose. It was
New Year's Eve. People were celebrating. They were all happy, but she was not.

She found a corner made by two houses. She sat down and tried to keep out of the wind. She drew her feet up close to her. But
she could not keep them warm. Her whole body grew colder. But she couldn't go home. She had not sold any matches today. She
had no money to bring to her family.
